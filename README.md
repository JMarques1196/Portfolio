# Welcome to My Portofolio
To run locally use npm install to install dependencies and then npm start.

## About:
I've built this portfolio using React and Sanity so its easy to update information. 

## Features:

### Snake Game
The home page features a working Snake Game.
You can use the Arrow keys to control the snake.
